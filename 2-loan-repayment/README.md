### Project Description
The client is the bank's credit department. It is necessary to determine whether a client's marital status and the 
number of children influence their ability to repay the loan on time. The input data from the bank consist of
statistics on clients' creditworthiness.

The results of this research will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model—a special system that 
evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.

- `days_employed` — total work experience in days
- `dob_years` — client's age in years
- `education` — client's education level
- `education_id` — education level identifier

The study aims to:
- Analyze and identify factors that influence a client's ability to repay loans on time.
