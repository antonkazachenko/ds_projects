## **Project Description**

The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:

- Moscow is a metropolis driven by the strict rhythm of the workweek;
- St. Petersburg is a city with a unique culture, unlike Moscow.

Some myths reflect reality, while others are mere stereotypes. Businesses need to distinguish between the two in order to make rational decisions. Using real data from Yandex Music, you will test hypotheses and compare the behavior of users in both capitals.

### **Hypotheses**

1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and this manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
2. On Monday mornings, the prevalent music genres in Moscow are different from those in St. Petersburg. The same applies to Friday evenings.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. In Moscow, pop music is listened to more, while in St. Petersburg, Russian rap is more popular.

### Data Column Descriptions:

- **userID** — user identifier;
- **Track** — track title;
- **artist** — artist name;
- **genre** — genre name;
- **City** — user's city;
- **time** — time the track was played;
- **Day** — day of the week.

## **Analysis Results**

### Working Hypotheses:

* Music is listened too differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

* The top ten most popular genres on Monday morning and Friday evening have distinct differences.

* The populations of the two cities prefer different music genres.

### **General Results**

Moscow and St. Petersburg share similar tastes, with pop music being dominant in both cities. There is no significant variation in preferences depending on the day of the week within each city—people consistently listen to what they enjoy. However, between the cities, there is a mirrored pattern in terms of listening behavior during the week: Moscow listens more on Monday and Friday, while St. Petersburg listens more on Wednesday and less on Monday and Friday.

As a result, the first and second hypotheses are confirmed, while the third hypothesis is not.
